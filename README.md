# Broken Clock
_It will be correct twice a day_

What is a broken clock?

I can show you.  See that clock on your wall?  Take it down and remove the battery.  Now put it back up on the wall.  You now have a broken clock.

Would you care to share what time you think it would be best to set it at?

## The general idea

This project will be to create a website that will show an analog clock that will be set to stay at a certain time.  Below it will be comments about the reason why that time was chosen.  Visitors to the site can enter their own time and reason it would be the ideal time to set a broken clock.  Some sort of voting system on the ideal time would be enabled which would set the default time to show for the broken clock on the website. 

To make things slightly more complex; visitors would need to tweet their entries with a hash tag of #brokenClock or something.  A scheduled process would then check for new tweets that had that hash tag and parse the ideal time from the content of the tweet.  These would be added to the site as embedded tweets under the time that was chosen and ranked by the number of hearts.

## Not planning on doing this project alone ...

Would you like to create a broken clock website?  Great!  Let's get organized.  First, we have to create some issues and assign them to projects or phases.  This way the amount of work doesn't get overwhelming, ya see.  We will follow a sort of kanban style of adding issues to columns of _To Do_, _In Progress_, and _Done_ for each phase.  If you see an issue that you want to take on then pick it off the To Do list and set it to In Progress.  Uhm, or something like that.

At this moment I'm mostly just making this up on the spot.  Haven't really created a project like this and managed it on github before.  I'll revise this as necessary.

**Start contributing by submitting issues.**  If there is something you would like to take on, or an idea of what else could be taken on by someone else; add it as an issue.  

## Idea Phase

Okay, so this is the initial phase.  It should be for simple prototypes, discussion and decision of what tech will be used, and better describing the project and scope.  See the [project board for the Idea Phase](https://github.com/jkenlooper/broken-clock/projects/1) to see what has been planned so far.
